# Telebirr

Telebirr is a fin-tech product that banks can use so that their customers can make UPI payments, and also make transactions through an app. I wasn't happy with how the home page of the original Telebirr applicaiton looked like. Therefore, I decided to build a single page application that has a better design. After the design gets accepted, I will surely continue on developing the rest of the pages and also the whole functionality.
